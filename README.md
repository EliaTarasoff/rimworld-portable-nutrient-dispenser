This mod adds a portable nutrient dispenser, for Rimworlders who want terrible-tasting food on the go!
It requires my other mod in order to function - 
the one that changes the [nutrient paste dispenser](https://github.com/EliaTarasoff/rimworld-nutrient-paste-dispenser).
(It needs the recipes for nutrient paste and nutrient bricks.)
