This mod adds a portable nutrient dispenser, for Rimworlders who want terrible-tasting food on the go!
It requires both of my other mods in order to function - 
the one for [portable stoves](https://github.com/EliaTarasoff/rimworld-portable-stoves),
and the one that changes the [nutrient paste dispenser](https://github.com/EliaTarasoff/rimworld-nutrient-paste-dispenser).
